-- next we are going to do some basic math and logic

females / males = sex_ratio..............equation01

females + males = population..............equation02

females = population - males..............equation03

-- next we substitute 'females' with 'population - males' from equation03
into equation01 

population - males = sex_ratio * males

population = males * ( sex_ratio + 1 )

-- finaly we conclude that :

### males = population / ( sex_ratio + 1 ).....equation04

-- next we replace 'males' from equation04 with the new value 

into equation03 or equation01 to get the number of females

### females = population - ( population / ( sex_ratio + 1 ))....from equation03
### females= ( population * sex_ratio ) / ( sex_ratio + 1 ).....from equation01
